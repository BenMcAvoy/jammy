## Reporting a Vulnerability

You can [contact me](mailto:ben.mcavoy@tutanota.com) to disclose a vulnerability if you believe it will impact other users if it is made public before it is patched. If you aren't sure if something could impact users, always go to the default of it being able to and contact me, many thanks!
I will get back to you as soon as I can and then you are free to write up whatever you please, thanks!
